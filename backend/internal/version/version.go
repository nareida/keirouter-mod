// Package version exposes the KeiRouter build version. It supports two sources,
// in priority order:
//
//  1. A value injected at build time via -ldflags "-X main.Version=...". This is
//     what release builds and `make build` use (derived from the git tag).
//  2. A committed VERSION file embedded into the binary. This is the fallback
//     for build environments that cannot inject ldflags or run git — notably
//     Docker/PaaS builds (Coolify, etc.) where the .git dir is absent. Because
//     the file is committed source, it always travels with the binary.
//
// The committed file means a deployed build reports a real version (e.g.
// "v0.1.6") instead of "dev", even when nothing stamps it at build time. Bump
// the VERSION file as part of cutting a release.
